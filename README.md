# ecmo_pulse_scripts

In order to generate graphs, you first need to run all the scripts to generate cvs files. Run `run_scripts/generate_cvs_files.py`
in order to accomplish this. You can then run `run_scripts/generate_graphs.py`. You must run these scripts in an environment set up with the Pusle bindings, refer to the Pulse documentation for Python for help.
